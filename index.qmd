# Preface {.unnumbered}

We live in the midst of the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity science, at first mostly a spin off from Ecology, has developed tremendously in the last two decades, becoming a truly interdisciplinary field, with contributions from Geography, Economy, Social Sciences and many other disciplines. Big data and the development of statistical ecology has also been remarkable. As I write these lines, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility or GBIF (<https://gbif.org>) is about to hit 3 billion records. The availability of large amounts of data and the availability of the open source R software (<https://www.r-project.org>) has made statistical approaches take the main stage in much of ecological research. However, at the same time, as a biodiversity researcher, practitioner, and a teacher, I find again and again the need for a good understanding of ecological theory to be able to carry out my work. This book if for all of you that have also felt a similar need.

Programming and mathematics are key tools of ecological theory. The programming language I use in this book is R (version 4). If you have familiarly with programming in another computer language, a fast skimming of Appendix A will be enough to get you going with the book. If you are new to programming, I recommend you spend a few hours working through the short course in Appendix A, but you may also wanna consult some web resources (e.g. <https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course>). With the advent of Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT there may be the temptation to think programming knowledge will no longer be needed. I think LLMs will accelerate our writing of computer code, but they will not replace the need for being able to read and understand the code.

*Explain choice or R and open software/science.* blabla

But programming is not enough. In order to be able to effectively develop theory and models of biodiversity, a good grasp of mathematics, including of probability and statistics is essential. One challenge is that, and this at least the case in Europe where I have lectured the most, most biology students receive very little mathematical training. This book cannot address by itself such gap and assumes some basic familiarity with probability theory (e.g. what is a probability distribution function), some calculus training (e.g. what area a derivative and an integral), a little algebra (e.g. multiplication of a matrix by a vector). I try to take the reader forward from that level. There are excellent books out there for those that need this basic background (e.g. Otto's and Day's A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modelling). And Wikipedia (<https://www.wikipedia.org>) is often your best friend when you wanna a fast refresh of any mathematical concept or even for many of the models and ecological concepts presented in this book.

*Structure of the book* blabla

This book can be used as the support for a semester course in Ecological Theory or Ecological Modelling. I have used many of these materials over the last decade in a similar course at iDiv/University of Halle-Wittenberg. But the book can also be used as self-learning tool or even as a reference tool. It takes a lot of experience from the Primer of Ecological Theory of Joan Roughgarden, that I was lucky to have as a mentor. As she used to say, one writes papers for the reviewers and books for the readers. This book is for you.
