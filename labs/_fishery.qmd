## Managing a fishery

1.  Consider that you are managing a fishery with the following dynamics: $$dn/dt = 0.2 n (1-n/10000) $$
    a)  Plot the production function of the fishery, indicating the stock size for the maximum sustainable yield and the corresponding production level.
    b)  Suppose you establish an annual quota that is equivalent to 50% of the maximum sustainable yield. What are the two stock size levels that sustainably allow that exploitation level?
    c)  Consider that there is an annual variance of 10% in the productivity. Explore what happen when you manage this fishery for 100 years at each of the two stock sizes determined in the previous question.
    d)  Explain why in a system with constant quotas, MSY is not stable and should not be the management goal.
    e)  Discuss how these results relate with the paper of Worm et al (2009) about the need to rebuild fisheries.
