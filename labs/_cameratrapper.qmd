## The camera trapper

A researcher place camera traps at a grid of sites during 19 days to observe roe-deer.

1.  Load the data on the file roe_deer_2016_r.xls into R. Briefly describe the structure of the dataset.

2.  Case 1: Ignoring detection probability.

    a)  Build a vector that for each site takes value 1 when roe-deer is present and 0 when is absent.
    b)  Using maximum-likelihood estimate the occupancy probability ($\Psi$). First create a function that takes as parameters psi and a vector of presence/absences and returns the likelihood. Then plot that function for a range of \$\\Psi\$ values and find the $\Psi$ value that maximizes the function.
    c)  Assume that based on previous work we know that occupancy is somewhat between 0.2 and 0.5. Using a Bayesian approach, calculate the posteriori probability distribution for the occupancy $P(\Psi)$.

    Set function for Bayesian approach:

    ``` r
    occupancybayesian <- function(v,psi,priorpsi)
    {
      integrand <- function(x)
          occupancylikelihood(v,x)*priorpsi(x)
      occupancylikelihood(v,psi)*priorpsi(psi)/
          integrate(integrand, lower = 0.01, upper = 0.99)$value
    }
    ```

    Set function for uninformed prior:

    ``` r
    uninformedprior <- function(psi) 
    { 
      dunif(psi,0.2,0.5) 
    }
    ```

3.  Case 2: Using a hierarchical model with detection probability

    a.  Using maximum-likelihood estimate the occupancy probability ($\Psi$) and detection probability ($p$).
