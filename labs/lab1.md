# LAB.1 -- Climate space of an ectotherm

**THE HEAT FLUX EQUATION**

Solar radiation and convection are the two main pathways for animals
such as small lizards. In this case, the total heat flux (*f*) into the
animal is given by:

$$f = q\ –h*(b - a)$$

-   $q$ = solar radiation (cal/h)

-   $h*(b - a)$ = heat loss through convection

-   \$b\$= body temperature of the animal (ºC)

-   $a$ = air temperature (ºC)

-   $h$ = convection heat transfer coefficient (cal/h/ ºC)

1.  ***Equilibrium body temperature***

<!-- -->

a)  Assuming that air temperature is 18ºC, and **h** = 50 cal/h, plot
    the lizard's equilibrium body temperature as a function of solar
    radiation. Assume that solar radiation varies between 0 and 1500
    cal/h

2.  ***Climate space of a Lizard***

<!-- -->

a)  Draw the climate space of the lizard by drawing the polygon that is
    limited by the minimum and maximum temperatures that the lizard can
    support, as a function of solar radiation. Consider that the upper
    lethal limit for the body temperature (***bmax***) is 36ºC and the
    lower lethal limit for the body temperature (***bmin***) is 24ºC.

**Hint:** *polygon{graphics}* - draws the polygons whose vertices are
given in x and y.

3.  ***Air Temperature and solar radiation throughout the day in two
    locations***

<!-- -->

a)  Plot the following values of air temperature and solar radiation
    that are available throughout a day in two locations. For:

-   Times of the day

> *t = c("00:00","03:00","06:00","09:00",*
>
> *"12:00","15:00","18:00","21:00","00:00")*

-   Solar radiation in the rock habitat

> *rock_q = c(150,150,800,1100,1300,1200,800,400,150)*

-   Air temperature in the rock habitat

> *rock_a = c(18,13,10,14,21,24,22,20,18)*

-   Solar radiation in the bush habitat

> *bush_q = c(150,150,450,600,650,650,350,200,150)*

-   Air temperature in the bush habitat

> bush_a = c(18,13,10,14,21,24,22,20,18)

b)  At which time of the day is the lizard on the rock, and at which
    time is it at the bush? Is there any time when the lizard cannot be
    at any of the locations?
