**Goals of the exercise**:

-   Identify road segments with hotspots of red fox-car-collisions.

-   What impact do activity patterns have on the rate of animal-car-collision hotspots?

-   Use the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method to identify such hotspots.

1.  Please install the following R packages

``` r
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(fuzzySim)
library(grid)
```

a.  Load the *roadkill* dataset.
b.  Explain the structure of the dataset.
c.  Show that differences in seasonal activity patterns impact the FDR hotspot results in red fox-car-collisions.
d.  How many hotspots were detected for the active season?
e.  Plot, based on the FDR method, true and “false” hotspots. Explain the general geographic locations of the hotspots and those vary between the two different seasons.
f.  Think about conservation management implications.
